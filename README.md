# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution - Challenge nr 1

I will be challenging myself to finish as many Frontend Mentor Challenges as possible in the next month.
This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

My plan is to do as many Frontend Mentor challenges as I can, starting easy to get back into my rythm after a short hiatus and continuing with the hardest ones.
